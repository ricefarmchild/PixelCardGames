# Pixel Card Games
This is a repository for an iOS game I made going into my first year of high school, which I called 2P Card Games for a while and then somewhere along the line I changed the name to Pixel Card Games because for some reason my dumbass thought it would do better on the App Store (lmao).

### The link for the game on the App Store can be found here:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixel-card-games/id1293947013

All assets, excluding the font, sound effects, and music, are designed by me. Since I can't figure out how to upload the assets onto GitHub, you unfortunately can't use them (it's more than 100 files :p)

This game was my first ever app uploaded onto the App Store. I hope you find it enjoyable (although it may be kinda silly xd)
