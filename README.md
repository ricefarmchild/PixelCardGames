# Pixel Card Games
This is a repository for an iOS game I made going into my first year of high school, which I called 2P Card Games for a while and then somewhere along the line I changed the name to Pixel Card Games because for some reason my dumbass thought it would do better on the App Store (lmao).

### The link for the game on the App Store can be found here:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixel-card-games/id1293947013

All assets, excluding the font, sound effects, and music, are designed by me. If you would like to use them, feel free to do so (no idea why you would want to though lmao they kinda trash imo but again, feel free)

This game was my first ever app uploaded onto the App Store. I hope you find it enjoyable (while it may be kinda dumb xd)
